            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IT hath been the earneſt deſire of my Soul to ſee you in the fleſh, to rejoyce together, and congratulate that longed for Chriſtian <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> which our King hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to grant unto all his Subjects. Let no man heneceforth judge to the outward appearance, nor paſs ſentence on a bare <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility.</hi> Truly about four years ago,
<hi>The Duke of</hi> York's <hi>Succeſſion</hi> to the Crown, was a <hi>Bug-bear</hi> of
<hi>Inquiſition</hi> that frightned three Nations out of their wits: But like
<hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Lyon and Riddle, <hi>Out of the Eater came forth meat, and out of the ſtrong hath come forth ſweetneſs.</hi> This is the Lord's doing, and it is wonderful in our eyes.</p>
            <p>Truly <hi>(Beloved Brethren and Siſtens)</hi> tho' <hi>the Conſcience cannot be compelled,</hi> the Oppreſſion and Tyranny we were under, theſe ſeveral years by paſt, was a great ſtumbling block in the way of our pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; when the wicked and ungodly did rob us under pretence of Religion; and threaten to knock us in the heads for Conſcience ſake: impriſoning us becauſe we did not pay to the <hi>Tithe-takers, Hirelings, Babie-ſprinklers</hi> whatever they pleaſed. <hi>Heli</hi>'s Sons made the Lord's Offering to be abhorred, becauſe they did exact upon the people, and took according to their own pleaſure by force. <hi>Paul</hi> could rather willingly work for his Living than be burdenſom to the Flock over
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40157:3"/>which the Holy Ghoſt had made him Over-ſeer: Therefore ſaid to the <hi>Corinthians, I will not be burdenſom to you; For I ſeek not yours but you.</hi> But Thieves and Robbers, who enter not at the door, but climb up by the walls may invert the order, and ſay, <hi>I ſeek not you, but yours.</hi>

               </gap>e be left in the Wilderneſs of our own weakneſs, and be deſtroyed by the old fiery Serpent.</p>
            <p>But above all things <hi>(My beloved Lambs)</hi> ſince God and the King have given us freedom of Truth, let every one uſe his talent to the beſt advantage; (and laying aſide all malice, guile, and hypocriſie, ſloth, and covetouſneſs;) ſtand upon his Watch-Tower, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the voice and coming of the Bridegroom of our Souls: for the Devil is buſier now, and hath more advantage to gain ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us than when we were made cautious by the conſtant alarums of our aſſaulting Enemy. Outward croſſes drive a man to inward Piety and tranquillity of mind.
<hi>Sorrow is better than laughter</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>) <hi>for by the ſadneſs of the Countenance the heart is made better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The blood of the Martyrs was reputed the ſeed of the Primitive Church. <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Army was indefatigable, and by the <hi>Romans</hi> eſteemed invincible, till they gave themſelves to eaſe, wine, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous diet. <hi>Noah</hi> was not drunk, whilſt he was in fear of the flood,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40157:3"/>building an Ark for his own ſafety. <hi>Lot</hi> was not inſnar'd in unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whilſt the wicked in <hi>Sodom</hi> daily vexed his Soul.</p>
            <p>Be watchful then (my dearly beloved) leſt ye defile your Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the ſhame of your nakedneſs be ſeen. The Conſcience is <hi>The Holy of Holies,</hi> which the great <hi>High Prieſt</hi> only doth enter. It is the Candle of the Lord that giveth light to our path, the
<hi>primum mobile</hi> of the little world. The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters, when darkneſs covered the face of the Deep: Even ſo the light of the Conſcience ſhineth and giveth light to the inner Man, tho no outward Sun, Moon, nor Star appear. It is a Lanthorn which none can extinguiſh but he who beareth it. Keep then your hearts with all diligence, and Conſciences void of offence towards God and Man.</p>
            <p>Above all things (My Brethren) Love one another; Love is the Badge of Chriſtianity, and the mark of the true Church. <hi>Appolyon</hi> the deſtroying King of the bottomleſs Pit, dare not ſhew his face where true love is. <hi>Love, Life,</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> are the Epethites by which God expreſſeth himſelf. They are inſeparable concomitants, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are, God is not far off. <hi>Love worketh no ill to his Neighbour; therefore love is the fulfilling of the Law. It ſuffereth long, and is kind, it envieth not, it vaunteth not it ſelf, it is not puffed up, it doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have it ſelf unſeemly, ſeeketh not her own, is not eaſily provoked, thinketh no evil, rejoyceth not in iniquity, but rejoyceth in the truth: Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things;</hi> and in one word,
<hi>Love never faileth.</hi> But be not deceived (My dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Siſters) <hi>If any man love the World, the love of the Eather is not in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be merciful one to another, for the merciful doth obtain mercy. Rather ſuffer injury than be heard before thoſe which are none of our Society. Let never a perſecuting ſpirit have dominion over you; but learn of Chriſt to be meek and lowly. Carnal weapons, <hi>Inſtruments of Cruelty,</hi> have no ſympathy with the <hi>ſword of the Spirit,</hi> wherewith Chriſt overcame <hi>The Wicked One,</hi> and reconcil'd the world to God again.</p>
            <p>That man that walketh on Crutches, is never ſtrong in the Limbs: A Religion <hi>by Law Eſtabliſhed</hi> is horrible Non-ſence, Law and Goſpel are <hi>repugnantia in adjecto,</hi> they never agree well together, 'tis a Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Religion; like <hi>hyſteron proteron,</hi> or a man walking backwards.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40157:4"/>
               <hi>A Conſcience regulate by human Power,</hi> is like a Diamond ſet in Braſs, or a Glaſs with Iron Hoops, a <hi>Fox</hi> keeping Sheep, or a Malefactor made a Judge. <hi>Paul</hi> appealed to <hi>Caeſar</hi> and loſt his Head for his pains. Therefore that Church that maketh the arm of Fleſh her truſt, may be queſtioned whether ſhe be the true Church or not. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> (tho they knew the truth of their Religion) did not force the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to accept of it, but ſet
<hi>life and death before them;</hi> but the puniſhment of obſtinacy they left to the Lord.

               <hi>Paul</hi>'s Perſecution (tho it was zeal wrapt up in ignorance) was a heinous ſin before the Lord. None muſt do evil that good <hi>may</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. He that would propagate and enlarge God's Church by Blood and Perſecution is like one who (under pretence of zeal) would ſteal money to give the poor, and ſo make his Theft the Author of his Charity</p>
            <p>The Church is Chriſt's Spouſe, the Bride, the Lambs Wife; he fought a duel with the Devil and Death for her, his right is good: Let him then be head of his own Body, if any thing be interpoſed the Son of Righteouſneſs is Eclipſed, and darkneſs is over the whole Members.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and Teſts are but the Patrons of Hypocriſie, and the Sword of the Spirit of Antichriſt; <hi>Hob-goblings</hi> of Apoſtacy wrapt up in Sheeps Cloathing which (at a diſtant ſeem innocent, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching nearer found to be like revenous Wolves) which frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40157:4"/>Men in the Kingdom of Darkneſs to ſacrifice both Faith and Conſcience to brazen fac'd Babylonian violence and humane power.</p>
            <p>Let God then be Guardian of his own Church; The Spirit of meekneſs is not a Spirit of outward violence, but a ſtill and calm voice. One who was my Perſecuter in a ſober fit told me, he never lik'd the Religion that was thruſt in at a Man's Broad-ſide with the point of a Sword; yet however it be the Devil is no gainer: For the Palm of victory flouriſheth beſt under the burden of Perſecution, when the Children of Men Lord it over God's heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Be ſtedfaſt then and Waver not, neither draw back whatſoever be your condition; ſweet Meats muſt be eaten with ſour Sauce, good Bees draw Hony from bitter Herbs; the Rod and the Staff go well together, outward Troubles are the <hi>Pravoes</hi> Spiritual which drive us within the line of the Church-militant. The Lord thought it not fit to caſt out all the Enemies of the Children of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> in one year, leſt the Beaſts of the field ſhould prevail againſt them; even ſo, if we had no Temptations to drive us to the Throne of Grace, and keep us on our guard, we would become ſecure and confide in our own ſelves, and our own bruitiſh and corrupt Natures would prevail againſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fear God and keep his Commandments, for this is the whole Duty of Man; pure Religion, and undefiled before God, and the Father is this, to viſit the Fatherleſs, and Widows in their affliction, and to keep himſelf unſpotted from the World.</hi> Let every one order his Converſation aright, and ſtrive to keep free from all known ſin, and to him that hath learned this leſſon, God will ſhew what further he would have done; according to that of the King and Prophet <hi>David. To him that ordereth his Converſation aright, will I ſhew the Salvation of God: For the ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant.</hi> Thus, it is not Sayers, nor bare Believers that are juſtified before God, and to whom he giveth the Spirit of diſcerning to chuſe the good, and refuſe the evil; but, <hi>What Man is he that feareth the Lord, him ſhall he teach in the Way that he ſhall chuſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do not err then my beloved Brethren, neither give heed to the various Opinions of Men of Corrupt Minds, diſtitute of the Truth, and toſt aboue with the Wind of the Times; changing their Doctrin for filthy Lucar's ſake, and unadviſedly contradicting their former Aſſertions.
<hi>The Goſpel of Chriſt is but one; and every good gift comes down from the Father of Light; with whom is no variableneſs, nor ſhadow of turning.</hi> Fix not your <hi>Faith</hi> to a
<hi>future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency,</hi> nor tip your belief with the turnings of Time; a Poet exclaiming againſt this Evil, ſaith,</p>

            <p>Neither give your ſelves to read idle Controverſies, though they be guilded with the Title

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40157:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>thing in divers ſhapes) the World is darkned, and the key of Knowledg laid by, and the Kingdom of Heaven ſhut up according to that of the Prophet, <hi>Thy Wiſdom, and thy Knowledg, it hath peruerted thee;</hi> a Woman once going to be burnt at the Stake, for being a Chriſtian, anſwered, thoſe who would by Arguments perſwaded her to renounce her Religion, <hi>I cannot diſpute for Chriſt, but I can die for Chriſt.</hi> Be ready then (like this Woman) rather to ſuffer, then by Seditious Arguments to give offence.</p>
            <p>Finally (My Beloved Lambs) <hi>Let your Moderation be known unto all Men, the Lord is at hand. For he that walketh uprightly walketh ſurely.</hi> Give no offence, <hi>But ſubmit your ſelves to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord</hi>'s <hi>ſake, whither it be to the King as ſupream: Or unto Governours, as unto them that are ſent by him, for the Puniſhment of evil doers, and for the Praiſe of them that do well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had our Noble and Heroick King ſtood out againſt that Principle that perſwaded him to the Religion he now Profeſſes, he had been much to blame; but now conſidering his Courage (which hath leap'd over the Wall of Worldly Temptations and stumbling Block of the feat of loſing his Crown and Kindom) he is a greater Conquerour then <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> and more Powerful then any of his Anceſtors. It is the Lord's work and doing, therefore let no Man grudge or repine: <hi>For the Powers that be, are ordained of GOD; Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God.</hi> Therefore with the Apoſtle, <hi>Honour all Men, Love the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Hood, Fear God, Honour the KING.</hi> Be charitable in Opinion, and Judge no Man, eſpecially theſe that are without: <hi>Paul</hi> was much dejected to think that the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> his Kinsfolk ſhould not be Saved; but after ſerious and deep Meditation, he cryeth out as with a <hi>Plaudite, God hath ſhut them all up together in unbelief, that he might have Mercy upon them all; O the depth of the Riches both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God! How unſearehable are his Judgments, and his Waies paſt finding out.</hi> It is very obſervable that the Apoſtle telleth, that after the Elected <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſealed in the Fore heads, <hi>be ſaw a great Multitude, which no Man could Number, of all Nations; and Kindreds, and People, and Tongues, which ſtood before the Throne, and before the Lamb, cloathed with White Robes, and Palms in their hands.</hi> Grace and Peace then be upon all the
<hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, and all thoſe who love our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in
<hi>Sincerity;</hi> for there is neither <hi>Greek,</hi> nor <hi>Jew,</hi> Circumciſion, nor Uncircumciſion, <hi>Barbarian, Scythian, Bond,</hi> nor <hi>Free, but Chriſt is all, and in all.</hi>
